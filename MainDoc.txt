I want to capture:
The fast-paced combat
Shot clock for turns?
The deception, the planning
Planning and then revealing moves
Like a card game.
Or a hidden movement game
Mechanic idea:
If-then:
Battle mechanic similar to programming.
Players write the first thing they want to do.
Then write the 2nd based on a condition
Looks like
Circle around and attack.
If they throw a punch,
Use substitution jutsu
Rock-paper-scissors
Strike beats grab, grab beats block, block beats strike
When 2 moves “Clash”
The move with the lower Delay wins, interrupting the move with the higher delay
If equal Delay, the move with the higher strength wins



Combat works like this:
You have a dice pool and an index card
Each round, you write down your character’s PRIMARY and ANTICIPATORY actions.
You allocate as many dice from your pool as you want to your primary or anticipatory actions.
If one of your actions conflicts with one of their actions (for example, grab vs block), whoever’s dice total is highest wins
Fighting moves have the attributes
Delay/Time-To-Hit – How fast a move can be executed. Like initiative in D&D, it determines which move fires off first when two moves “clash”. Unlike initiative, the lower the number, the better. For example, if a move with a Delay of 2 clashes with a move with Delay of 4, the Delay-2 move interrupts the Delay-4 move
Strength – Damage done by move.
Cooldown/Time-To-Recover – How long a character must wait before executing a new move.
Custom
Describes any additional effects a move that successfully lands has.
